Well, as name suggests this is my learning project, as it is made in UE 5.5.4
For now there is implemented:
  [X] 3D camera orbiting around focus point
  [X] 3D camera zoom with scroll (10 points linear zoom, i hope animating it in tics isn't some profanation)
  [ ] Control over focus point W.I.P
  [ ] More to be added
  
It ain't much but it's honest work
