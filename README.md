# UE 5.5.4 Learning Project

Well, as the name suggests — this is my learning project, built with Unreal Engine **5.5.4**.

I'm using this space to experiment, try things out, and get a better feel for UE.

## ✅ Current Features

- [x] **3D Camera Orbit**  
  Orbiting around a focus point — smooth and responsive.

- [x] **3D Camera Zoom**  
  Zoom in/out with the scroll wheel using a 10-point linear zoom.  
  (Yes, it's animated with ticks — and no, I don't think it's profanation 😉)

- [X] **Control Over Camera Focus Point By Navigating Mouse To The Edges Of The Screen**  
  Basic rts camera controll.

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

- [ ] **Click to Move Camera Focus Point To Pointed Destination**  

- [ ] **Camera Focus Point Sticking To Landscape**  

- [ ] **More to Come**  
  One step at a time.
