# UE 5.5.4 Learning Project

Well, as the name suggests — this is my learning project, built with Unreal Engine **5.5.4**.

I'm using this space to experiment, try things out, and get a better feel for UE.

## ✅ Current Features

- [x] **3D Camera Orbit**  
  Orbiting around a focus point — smooth and responsive.

- [x] **3D Camera Zoom**  
  Zoom in/out with the scroll wheel using a 10-point linear zoom.  

- [X] **Control Over Camera Focus Point By Navigating Mouse To The Edges Of The Screen**  
  Basic rts camera controll.

- [X] **Camera Focus Point Sticking To Landscape**  
  Based on Line trace, single point, no falling into pits secured by clamp.

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

- [ ] **Click to Move Camera Focus Point To Pointed Destination**  

- [ ] **Minimap**🛠️ 

- [ ] **More to Come**  
  One step at a time.

## 🧪 Cool but Unlikely Ideas

These are things that would be awesome to implement one day, but realistically… probably not anytime soon.

- [ ] **More Advanced Camera Sticking**  
  Runtime Virtual Texturing (RVT)/Height map sampling
